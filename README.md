# vt_timesketch
Virustotal Data to Timesketch

# idea

Idea of that script is to get a list of domains / ips and pull timeline relevant infos from VT.
The output should be already timesketchable.

# usage

  
   modify the config file
   paste your md5 hashes, ips, domains to the input.txt file
   run the script:
  ```
  python vt_lookup.py
   ```
   
   see the output in output.csv
   Copy output csv and add it to your timesketch instance.
   
   Happy digging
